# About

jumblestheclown is a beloved document listing almost a thousand unique anagrams. Jumbles was born in 2021, my beloved way to write down the anagrams I think of. I wanted to get practice with analyzing CSVs, and I was curious about certain statistics related to my document of anagrams. And so, jumblestherepo was born, as a way for me to gain further insights into my quest for anagrams.
